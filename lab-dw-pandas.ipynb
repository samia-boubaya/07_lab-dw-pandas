    "\n",
    "- Gender - Gender of the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Education - Background education of customers \n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer Lifetime Value - Customer lifetime value(CLV) is the total revenue the client will derive from their entire relationship with a customer. In other words, is the predicted or calculated value of a customer over their entire duration as a policyholder with the insurance company. It is an estimation of the net profit that the insurance company expects to generate from a customer throughout their relationship with the company. Customer Lifetime Value takes into account factors such as the duration of the customer's policy, premium payments, claim history, renewal likelihood, and potential additional services or products the customer may purchase. It helps insurers assess the long-term profitability and value associated with retaining a particular customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Income - Customers income\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly Premium Auto - Amount of money the customer pays on a monthly basis as a premium for their auto insurance coverage. It represents the recurring cost that the insured person must pay to maintain their insurance policy and receive coverage for potential damages, accidents, or other covered events related to their vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of Open Complaints - Number of complaints the customer opened\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy Type - There are three type of policies in car insurance (Corporate Auto, Personal Auto, and Special Auto)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vehicle Class - Type of vehicle classes that customers have Two-Door Car, Four-Door Car SUV, Luxury SUV, Sports Car, and Luxury Car\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total Claim Amount - the sum of all claims made by the customer. It represents the total monetary value of all approved claims for incidents such as accidents, theft, vandalism, or other covered events.\n"

    "*Note: When analyzing data, we often want to focus on certain groups of values to gain insights. Percentiles are a useful tool to help us define these groups. A percentile is a measure that tells us what percentage of values in a dataset are below a certain value. For example, the 75th percentile represents the value below which 75% of the data falls. Similarly, the 25th percentile represents the value below which 25% of the data falls. When we talk about the top 25%, we are referring to the values that fall above the 75th percentile, which represent the top quarter of the data. On the other hand, when we talk about the bottom 25%, we are referring to the values that fall below the 25th percentile, which represent the bottom quarter of the data. By focusing on these groups, we can identify patterns and trends that may be useful for making decisions and taking action.*\n",
