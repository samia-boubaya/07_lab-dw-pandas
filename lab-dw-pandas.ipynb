    "- Create Pandas DataFrames from CSV files.\n",
    "- Explore Pandas DataFrames to get the **number of rows, columns, summary statistics and data types**.\n",
    "- **Manipulate Series objects using various methods**, including `sort_values` or `value_counts`.\n",
    "- **Access data in DataFrames through columns** (as a dictionary or attribute) and by **using** `loc` or `iloc` to **access rows**.\n",
    "- **Filter** and **select data** in DataFrames **using simple comparison and logical operators**\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this lab, you will learn how to work with and create pandas series and dataframes. \n",
    "- These are powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis in Python \n",
    "  - and allow you to create, manipulate, and analyze large, complex datasets with ease,*\n",
    "    - making it a valuable library for any data scientist or analyst.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will also learn how to access their attributes and values, \n",
    "  - and manipulate them using a variety of built-in methods as well as learn how to filter and sort data and summarize and describe data. \n",
